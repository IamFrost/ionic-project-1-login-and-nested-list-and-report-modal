# api link:

https://github.com/IamFrost/api-2-build-a-restapi-postgres-golang-master

# note 1:

don't forget to run custom scripts for api, check the package.json file , and run like this : npm run script_name

example:
npm run rs

watch out when running scripts, they use ports, also data.service.ts is using some ports, make sure any other applications are not using them
